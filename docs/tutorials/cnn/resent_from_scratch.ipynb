Where to go from here\n","\n","There are some additional details involved in a robust implementation which have been skipped in this tutorial.\n","\n","* Every layer should be named appropriately.\n","* Some image processing systmes may follow channels first approach where the image dimensions are (3,224,224). \n","* Every image needs to go through a basic preprocessing. This involves, convering the image to BGR format (from RGB) if necessary, then zero center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset.\n","* Loading the pretrained weights using the model.load_weights function.\n","* Add a global pooling if the top classification network is ignored.\n","\n","For a more complete implementation addressing these aspects, please look at the source code in Keras Applications repository mentioned above. \n","\n","We hope that we have been able to give you a first hand experience of building large and complex convolutional networks easily with the help of Keras.\n","\n","Enjoy!
